<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Description

Continuous Compliance makes it possible to enforce company policy on repositories. Continuous Compliance will automatically check your repository for mandatory files or requirements. When possible, it will create detailed Github issue with instructions on how to resolve it.

## State

Work in progress - We're testing this action internally at this moment...  
If you want to stay updated, hit the "Watch" button.

## Background

Philips was looking for a way to automatically enforce certain policy in their innersource [philips-internal](https://github.com/philips-internal) organization.
After stumbling upon Repolinter and Newrelics Action, we decided we wanted something slightly different and more versatile. We started working on a fork of Repolinter, one that introduced the ability create different GitHub issues per rule that was broken. After having this specific functionality added, we needed a way to automatically check the 5000+ repositories within our internal organization. This is when Continuous Compliance was born. We have used it for several months internally, and learned a lot by doing so. By publishing the source code, we want to share it with a broader community. We have migrated our internal Continuous Compliance, to use this open source one(have to eat your own dog food!).

### Built With

- [Repolinter](https://github.com/philips-forks/repolinter) (forked, [original here](https://github.com/todogroup/repolinter))
